\chapter{\label{ch:ch4} Design ad Implementation}

This is the design chapter intro and explaining structure etc.

\section{\label{sec:ch4_firstsec}System Design}

This section presents the system design with nice illustrations.
\section{\label{sec:sys_architecture} System Architecture}

The project is composed of several key components, below is a high level overview of all the components that are needed in order execute the project properly.

\begin{tabular}{|p{5cm}|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
Microcontroller/Processor & Manages computer vision algorithms and interfaces with hardware. Responsible for overall system control and data processing. \\ \hline
Web Camera & Provides real-time video feed for remote monitoring and vision tasks. Captures high-quality images for processing. \\ \hline
Motor and Drive System & Four-wheel drive system for robot mobility. Includes motors and a motor controller for precise movement control.\\ \hline
Fiducial Markers & Visual markers (e.g., ArUco or AprilTag) placed in the environment to assist with localization and navigation.\\ \hline
Web-based Control Interface & Allows remote control of the robotâ€™s movements and camera functions, with video streaming capabilities. \\ \hline
Power Supply & Provides electrical power to all components of the system. Needs to support extended operation and peak power demands. \\ \hline
Chassis & Physical structure of the robot that houses and protects all components. Designed for durability and optimal component placement.  \\ \hline
Sensors & Additional sensors for environmental awareness (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, IMU, GPS).\\  \hline
Communication Module & Enables wireless communication between the robot and the control interface, supporting long-range and reliable data transmission. \\ \hline
