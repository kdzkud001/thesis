\chapter{Results and Discussion}

This chapter presents the results of the testing and evaluation process outlined in the previous chapter, focusing on how the system performed in real-world conditions. The integration of the web interface, ArUco marker detection, and motor control has been fully implemented, and this chapter aims to assess the performance of these subsystems when working together. 

Each aspect of the system, from real-time video streaming to ArUco marker-based navigation, is evaluated according to the Acceptance Test Procedures (ATPs) defined earlier in the project. The discussion will focus on the key metrics such as latency, detection accuracy, and system responsiveness. Any challenges encountered during testing, as well as any deviations from expected outcomes, will be analyzed to provide insight into potential areas for improvement.

In this chapter, I will:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Present the outcomes of the individual and integrated system tests.
	\item Analyze how well the system meets the predefined objectives and ATPs.
	\item Discuss the implications of the findings, identifying both the strengths and weaknesses of the implemented solution.
	\item Highlight any areas where optimization was required or could be further pursued to enhance system performance.
\end{itemize}
